This is prepared to run profiling using UNIX's perf and Flamegraph[0].

The "profiler.sh" script should be copied into the system's local copy
of the git repo of flamegraph[1].
The script should be granted execution permissions, e.g.

  $ chmod +x path/to/profiler.sh

Then simply invoke the script passing the executable command as argument,
e.g.

  $ path/to/profiler.sh fig models/tandem_queue.sa --amono --stop-time 10

This will generate a series of trace."ext" files with various "ext"ensions.
The final result is the .svg file, which can be opened with any web browser.


Some sample profiling traces for various FIG models and run configurations
are also included in this directory. View the .svg files with a web browser.
