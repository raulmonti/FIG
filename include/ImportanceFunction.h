/**
 * @brief Abstract base importance assessor (or function)
 *
 *        Importance functions are required for the application of
 *        importance splitting techniques during Monte Carlo simulations.
 *        Based on an identifyable set of "rare states", importance functions
 *        are in charge of assessing how likely it is to visit such set
 *        from <i>each other</i> (reachable) system state.
 *
 *        Besides from the "name" which specifies the ImportanceFunction
 *        derived class, importance assessment requires the choice of a
 *        "strategy" (flat, auto, ad hoc...) to decide how the relative
 *        importance between states will be measured.
