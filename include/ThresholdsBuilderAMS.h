/**
 * @brief ThresholdsBuilder implementing Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (AMS)
 *
 *        AMS is a thresholds building technique which takes its name from
 *        an article published by Cerou and Guyader in 2007.
 *        Given a state space and an importance function on it, AMS aims to
 *        locate the thresholds so that all the probabilities 'P_i' are roughly
 *        the same. Here 'P_i' is defined as the conditional probability of a
 *        simulation run traversing the i-th level upwards, that is, going up
 *        the i-th importance threshold having started at the (i-1)-th threshold.
