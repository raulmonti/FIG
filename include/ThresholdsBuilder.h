 * @brief Asbtract base builder of importance thresholds.

 *        Importance thresholds are required for the application of
 *        importance splitting techniques during Monte Carlo simulations.
 *        For instance in the RESTART method everytime a simulation crosses a
 *        threshold "upwards", i.e. gaining on importance, the state is saved
 *        and the simulation run is replicated a predefined number of times.
 *        Oppositely, when a simulation crosses a threshold "downwards"
 *        loosing on importance, it is discarded.

	 *        The thresholds are built in 'impVec', which is 'impFun's
	 *        internal vector of ImportanceValue. This means 'impVec' holds
	 *        the importance of the concrete states from some Module.
	 *        Original importance information is destroyed: after the call
	 *        'impVec[i]' will hold the level of the i-th concrete state,
	 *        where the j-th level is composed of all the states between the
	 *        j-th and the (j+1)-th thresholds.
	 *        The result can be regarded as a coarser version of the original
	 *        importance information which 'impFun' held before this call.
	 *

	 * @param impVec Internal vector of impFun with ImportanceValue of concrete

	 * @throw FigException if thresholds building failed
