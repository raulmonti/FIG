/**
 * @brief Asbtract base builder of importance thresholds.
 *
 *        Importance thresholds are required for the application of
 *        importance splitting techniques during Monte Carlo simulations.
 *        For instance in the RESTART method everytime a simulation crosses a
 *        threshold "upwards", i.e. gaining on importance, the state is saved
 *        and the simulation run is replicated a predefined number of times.
 *        Oppositely, when a simulation crosses a threshold "downwards"
 *        loosing on importance, it is discarded.
