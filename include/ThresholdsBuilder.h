 * @brief Asbtract base builder of importance thresholds.
 *
 *        Importance thresholds are required for the application of
 *        importance splitting techniques during Monte Carlo simulations.
 *        For instance in the RESTART method everytime a simulation crosses a
 *        threshold "upwards", i.e. gaining on importance, the state is saved
 *        and the simulation run is replicated a predefined number of times.
 *        Oppositely, when a simulation crosses a threshold "downwards"
 *        loosing on importance, it is discarded.

	 * @brief Build thresholds from given concrete importance function.

	 *        The thresholds are built in 'impVec', which holds the importance
	 *        of the concrete states and is actually an internal vector from
	 *        the passed concrete importance function 'impFun'.
	 *        Original importance information is destroyed: after the call
	 *        'impVec[i]' will hold the level of the i-th concrete state,
	 *        where the j-th level is composed of all the states between the
	 *        j-th and the (j+1)-th thresholds.
	 *        The result can be regarded as a coarser version of the original
	 *        importance values which were fed into the routine.
	 *
