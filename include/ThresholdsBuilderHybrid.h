/**
 * @brief "Hybrid builder" of importance thresholds.
 *
 *        This member of the ThresholdsBuilder family combines adaptive
 *        techniques, studying the semantics of the user model, with fixed
 *        thresholds selection based on the splitting value chosen by the user.<br>
 *        The goal is to ensure termination of the thresholds building routine,
 *        resorting to a fixed, semantics-oblivious heuristic whenever the
 *        adaptive algorithms fail to terminate within predefined bounds.
 *        The resulting number of thresholds built is a random variable of
 *        the probability of reaching the highest ImportanceValue, also
 *        influenced by the user-specified splitting value.
 *
