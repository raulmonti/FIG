/**
 * @brief ThresholdsBuilder implementing Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
 *
 *        SMC is an <i>adaptive</i> thresholds building technique deviced and
 *        perfected by Cerou, Del Moral, Furon and Guyader in the article
 *        "Sequential Monte Carlo for rare event estimation" from 2011.
 *        It could be regarded as a statistically improved version of
 *        Adaptive Multilevel Splitting, the orginal algorithm published by
 *        Cerou and Guyader in 2007.<br>
 *        Just like AMS, given a state space and an importance function on it
 *        SMC aims to choose importance values as "thresholds" trying to make
 *        all the partial probabilities 'P_i' roughly equal. SMC differs
 *        from AMS in the way the internal Monte Carlo simulations are handled,
 *        improving the statistical virtues of the algorithm's iterations.
 *
