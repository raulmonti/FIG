/**
 * @brief Abstract ImportanceFunction for concrete importance assessment
 *
 *        The assessment is "concrete" because internal vectors are built and
 *        mantained with the ImportanceValue of each reachable concrete state,
 *        viz. importance information for the "concrete state space" is kept.<br>
 *        This can be extremely heavy on memory: precisely the size of the
 *        concrete state space of the assessed elements (ModuleInstance or
 *        ModuleNetwork). On the other hand it can be considerably more CPU
 *        efficient than on-the-fly importance assessment as
 *        \ref ImportanceFunctionAlgebraic "algebraic importance functions" do.
