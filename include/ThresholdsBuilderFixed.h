/**
 * @brief "Fixed builder" of importance thresholds.
 *
 *        In order to choose the thresholds among the \ref ImportanceValue
 *        "importance values" of the ImportanceFunction provided, this class
 *        uses a policy which is oblivious of the underlying user model.<br>
 *        The final resulting number of thresholds built is fully determined
 *        by the "useful range" of the ImportanceFunction (i.e. the difference
 *        between the max value and the initial value), the global effort
 *        selected by the user, and the post-processing applied to the
 *        importance values after their computation (if any).
