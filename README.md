  The FIG tool is sofware developed in FAMAF, UNC, Argentina, whose goal is to
estimate the probability of rare events using importance splitting techniques.

  This tool is designed as the simulation engine backend of a wider toolset
which implements Input/Output Stochastic Automate (IOSA) models. For a detailed
and formal description of those systems and this project visit the group's
webpage at http://dsg.famaf.unc.edu.ar.

  The project is entirely written in C++ and to date runs on linux systems only.
