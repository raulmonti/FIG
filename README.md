### Project

The goal of the FIG tool is to estimate the probability of rare events using importance splitting techniques, with the highest possible degree of automation.<br>
FIG is sofware developed in FAMAF, UNC, Argentina,

This tool is designed as the simulation engine backend of a wider toolset which will support analysis of a subset of Stochastic Automata (SA), namely Input/Output Stochastic Automata with Urgency (IOSA).
For a detailed and formal description of those systems and this project visit [the webpage of the DSG group](http://dsg.famaf.unc.edu.ar "DSG webpage") from [FAMAF](http://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/ "Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física, y Computación"), [UNC](https://www.unc.edu.ar/ "Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina").

The project is entirely written in C++ and to date has been tested on linux and mac systems.
FIG is free, open source software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.
FIG's logo is the Fig of Gold.
