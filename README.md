### Project

The FIG tool is sofware developed in FAMAF, UNC, Argentina, whose goal is to estimate the probability of rare events using importance splitting techniques.

This tool is designed as the simulation engine backend of a wider toolset which implements Input/Output Stochastic Automate (IOSA) models. For a detailed and formal description of those systems and this project visit the group's webpage at http://dsg.famaf.unc.edu.ar.

The project is entirely written in C++ and to date has been tested on linux and mac systems. FIG is free, open source software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3. FIG's logo is the Fig of Gold.
