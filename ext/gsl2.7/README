GSL extract for the FIG tool

Example usage for Gaussian inverse CDF
--------------------------------------

#include "include/gsl_cdf.h"

T-students CDF inverse: "gsl_cdf_tdist_Pinv()"
Gaussian   CDF inverse: "gsl_cdf_gaussian_Pinv()"

Both give the inverse CDF values for one-sided critical regions.
For usage on confidence intervals the value should be transformed to:

                        1-(1-p)/2

where 'p' is the CDF value whose inverse is queried.

Example:
         Suppose we're to compute a standard 90% CI using the CLT,
         from a sample with 'n' values whose (sample) mean is 'm'
         and (sample) standard deviation is 's'. The CI is thus:
                  [ m-t*s/sqrt(n) , m+t*s/sqrt(n) ]
         where 't' is the inverse CDF for a t-student distribution
         with n-1 degrees of freedom with significance 0.9/2.
         The value of 't' is computed from this code by calling:
              t = gsl_cdf_tdist_Pinv( 1-(1-0.9)/2, n-1)

Several PDFs and CDFs are included along the desired functionality,
as they are necessary for the computations of the above inverse CDFs:
 · include/gsl_cdf.h     has a list of all available CDFs and their inverse,
 · include/gsl_randist.h has a list of all available PDFs.

The GSL Manual has been published and can be ordered from most
bookstores. The publication details are,

  GNU Scientific Library Reference Manual - Revised Second Edition,

The money raised from sales of the manual helps support the
development of GSL.
